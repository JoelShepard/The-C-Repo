# C Programming Examples

Welcome to our C programming examples repository! This collection contains various C programs demonstrating different concepts and algorithms.

## Project Structure

- `hello.c`: A simple "Hello World" program
- `mcd_euclide.c`: Implementation of Euclidean algorithm for finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
- `verifica_email.c`: Email format verification program
- `perimetro_poligoni.c`: Program to calculate the perimeter of a polygon
- `poligoni.c`: Incomplete program for polygon-related operations

## Programs Overview

1. `hello.c`: Prints "hello world" to the console
2. `mcd_euclide.c`: Calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm
3. `verifica_email.c`: Checks if an email address is in a valid format
4. `perimetro_poligoni.c`: Calculates the perimeter of a polygon given its vertices
5. `poligoni.c`: Incomplete program for working with polygons

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run these programs, you'll need a C compiler like GCC. Use the following commands:

1. Compile: `gcc -o program_name program_name.c`
2. Run: `./program_name`

Replace `program_name` with the actual name of the C file you want to compile and run.
